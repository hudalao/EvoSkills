### ⛳️ Framework Overview

</p>

The diagram above shows the full EvoScientist pipeline. The **Researcher Agent** (top, blue) runs idea tree search and Elo tournament ranking to produce a research proposal. The **Engineer Agent** (bottom, green) executes the 4-stage experiment pipeline. The **Evolution Manager Agent** (right) manages three memory evolution mechanisms — IDE, IVE, and ESE — that feed learned knowledge back into **Ideation Memory (M_I)** and **Experimentation Memory (M_E)** for future cycles.

### 💡 `research-ideation` — Literature Tree & Problem Finding

The starting point of the research pipeline. Guides ideation from literature analysis to solution design:

- **Literature Tree** — Build a novelty tree and challenge-insight tree to map the research landscape
- **Problem Selection** — 4-level well-established solution check to identify open problems worth pursuing
- **Solution Design** — Cross-domain transfer and problem decomposition strategies
- **Paper Reading** — 3-level structured Q&A methodology for deep comprehension
- **Counterintuitive Rules** — Problem selection matters more than solution design; pursue new failure cases rather than incremental improvements

### 🏆 `idea-tournament` — Competitive Idea Ranking & Proposal Generation

Bridges the gap between having a research direction and having a concrete, validated proposal:

- **Tree-Structured Generation** — Expand a seed idea into up to N_I=21 candidates by varying technique, domain, and formulation axes
- **Elo Tournament** — Pairwise comparisons on 4 dimensions (novelty, feasibility, relevance, clarity) with Swiss-system pairing
- **Direction Summarization** — Synthesize top-3 ideas into promising directions for evo-memory
- **Proposal Extension** — Extend the winning idea into a full research proposal (5 sections from paper + 1 practical extension)
- **Counterintuitive Rules** — Quantity before quality; the tournament finds surprises; top-3 not top-1

### 📐 `paper-planning` — Research Paper Planning & Outline Generation

Guides pre-writing planning before a single word is drafted. Covers four key activities:

- **Story Design** — Reverse-engineer the narrative: task → challenge → insight → contribution → advantage
- **Experiment Planning** — Plan comparisons, ablations, and demo scenarios with structured checklists
- **Figure Design** — Pipeline figures that highlight novelty; teaser figures that hook reviewers
- **Timeline Management** — 4-week countdown schedule from outline to submission

Includes counterintuitive tactics: write your rejection letter first, narrow claims before broadening, and plan fallback narratives.

### 🧪 `experiment-pipeline` — 4-Stage Experiment Execution

A structured framework for executing research experiments with attempt budgets and gate conditions:

- **Stage 1: Initial Implementation** — Get baseline code running and reproduce known results (≤20 attempts)
- **Stage 2: Hyperparameter Tuning** — Optimize configuration for your setup (≤12 attempts)
- **Stage 3: Proposed Method** — Implement and validate the novel method (≤12 attempts)
- **Stage 4: Ablation Study** — Prove each component's contribution (≤18 attempts)
- **Code Trajectory Logging** — Structured attempt logging that feeds into `evo-memory`
- **Counterintuitive Rules** — Initial implementation is not wasted time; budget limits prevent rabbit holes; failed attempts are data

Integrates with `experiment-craft` for failure diagnosis within stages and `evo-memory` for cross-cycle learning.

### 🔧 `experiment-craft` — Experiment Debugging & Iteration

A systematic approach to experiment debugging, logging, and iterative improvement:

- **5-Step Diagnostic Flow** — Collect failures → find a working version → bridge the gap → hypothesize → fix
- **Counterintuitive Rules** — Change one variable at a time; effective experiments beat more experiments
- **Experiment Logging** — 5-section structured log template for reproducible records
- **Handoff to Paper-Writing** — Feed validated results and logs into `paper-writing` for drafting

### ✍️ `paper-writing` — Section-by-Section Paper Drafting

A proven 11-step workflow for writing academic papers with LaTeX templates:

- **Structured Process** — From pipeline sketch → story design → Method → Experiments → Related Work → Abstract → Title
- **Section Templates** — Three Abstract templates, four Introduction openers, Method module structure, Experiments organization
- **LaTeX Assets** — Annotated paper skeleton (`paper-skeleton.tex`) and booktabs table macros (`table-style.tex`)
- **Writing Principles** — One message per paragraph, topic sentence first, terminology consistency, reverse-outlining
- **Counterintuitive Tactics** — Underclaim in prose / overdeliver in evidence; lead with mechanism, not just metrics

### 🔍 `paper-review` — Self-Review & Quality Assurance

Systematic self-review before submission using adversarial and counterintuitive review strategies:

- **5-Aspect Checklist** — Contribution sufficiency, writing clarity, results quality, testing completeness, method design
- **Reverse-Outlining** — Extract the outline from finished paragraphs to verify logical flow
- **Figure & Table Quality Checks** — Captions, resolution, booktabs, color-blind friendliness
- **Rejection Simulation** — Force a reject summary first; attack your own novelty claim
- **Handoff to Rebuttal** — After review, feed identified weaknesses into `paper-rebuttal` for response preparation

### 💬 `paper-rebuttal` — Rebuttal Writing After Peer Review

Dedicated rebuttal skill for responding to reviewer feedback after peer review:

- **Score Diagnosis** — Color-code every reviewer comment: red (critical), orange (important), gray (minor), green (positive)
- **Champion Strategy** — Arm your most positive reviewer with evidence for the Area Chair discussion
- **Tactical Writing** — 18 rules for structure, content, and tone in rebuttal responses
- **Counterintuitive Principles** — Submit even with extreme scores; concede small points to win the big argument
- **Common Concerns** — Response strategies for 12 frequently raised reviewer complaints

### 🎤 `academic-slides` — Presentation & Research Talk Creation

A structured approach to creating academic presentations and preparing research talks:

- **Narrative Arc** — Define scope, audience, and key takeaway before touching slides
- **Slide Design** — 10 design rules, visual hierarchy, one idea per slide, claim-style titles
- **Practical Creation** — `.pptx` file generation with color palettes, layout code, charts, and figures
- **Delivery & Q&A** — Rehearsal protocol, timing, and backup slide preparation
- **Counterintuitive Rules** — Slides are not your paper; enthusiasm beats polish; related work builds motivation, not citation counts

### 🧠 `evo-memory` — Persistent Research Memory & Self-Evolution

The learning layer that accumulates knowledge across research cycles. Maintains two memory stores and implements three evolution mechanisms:

- **Ideation Memory (M_I)** — Tracks feasible and unsuccessful research directions across idea tournaments
- **Experimentation Memory (M_E)** — Stores reusable data processing and model training strategies (paper core), plus architecture and debugging (extensions)
- **IDE (Idea Direction Evolution)** — Extracts promising directions after idea tournaments
- **IVE (Idea Validation Evolution)** — Classifies experiment failures as implementation vs fundamental direction failures
- **ESE (Experiment Strategy Evolution)** — Distills reusable patterns from successful experiment pipelines

Read by `idea-tournament` and `experiment-pipeline` at cycle start; updated after each cycle completes.
