### 💡 `research-ideation` — Literature Grounding, Tournament & Proposal

The starting point of the research pipeline. It now covers the full path from literature grounding to ranked ideas to a concrete proposal:

- **Load Prior Knowledge** — Read `evo-memory` first to reuse feasible directions and avoid known dead ends
- **Literature Grounding** — Use `paper-navigator` to collect and analyze papers before generating ideas
- **Multi-Track Ideation + Refinement** — Generate candidates across multiple personas, then iteratively strengthen them
- **Elo Tournament** — Rank refined ideas on novelty, feasibility, relevance, and clarity; present the top-3
- **Proposal Extension** — Expand the selected winner into a manuscript-quality research proposal

### 📝 `research-survey` — Literature Survey & Synthesis

Dedicated skill for turning a large paper collection into a structured survey report:

- **Adaptive Outline** — Generate a field-specific outline based on the query type and literature set
- **Draft + Expansion Pipeline** — Draft from top papers, then deepen each section with the full collection
- **Summary Refinement** — Build section summaries before rewriting the abstract, introduction, and conclusion
- **Survey-Grade Output** — Comparative tables, taxonomy-based method organization, dense citations, and references

### 📐 `paper-planning` — Research Paper Planning & Outline Generation

Guides pre-writing planning before a single word is drafted. Covers four key activities:

- **Story Design** — Reverse-engineer the narrative: task → challenge → insight → contribution → advantage
- **Experiment Planning** — Plan comparisons, ablations, and demo scenarios with structured checklists
- **Figure Design** — Pipeline figures that highlight novelty; teaser figures that hook reviewers
- **Timeline Management** — 4-week countdown schedule from outline to submission

Includes counterintuitive tactics: write your rejection letter first, narrow claims before broadening, and plan fallback narratives.

### 🧪 `experiment-pipeline` — 4-Stage Experiment Execution

A structured framework for executing research experiments with attempt budgets and gate conditions:

- **Stage 1: Initial Implementation** — Get baseline code running and reproduce known results (≤20 attempts)
- **Stage 2: Hyperparameter Tuning** — Optimize configuration for your setup (≤12 attempts)
- **Stage 3: Proposed Method** — Implement and validate the novel method (≤12 attempts)
- **Stage 4: Ablation Study** — Prove each component's contribution (≤18 attempts)
- **Code Trajectory Logging** — Structured attempt logging that feeds into `evo-memory`
- **Counterintuitive Rules** — Initial implementation is not wasted time; budget limits prevent rabbit holes; failed attempts are data

Integrates with `experiment-craft` for failure diagnosis within stages and `evo-memory` for cross-cycle learning.

### 🔧 `experiment-craft` — Experiment Debugging & Iteration

A systematic approach to experiment debugging, logging, and iterative improvement:

- **5-Step Diagnostic Flow** — Collect failures → find a working version → bridge the gap → hypothesize → fix
- **Counterintuitive Rules** — Change one variable at a time; effective experiments beat more experiments
- **Experiment Logging** — 5-section structured log template for reproducible records
- **Handoff to Paper-Writing** — Feed validated results and logs into `paper-writing` for drafting

### 🔄 `experiment-iterative-coder` — Iterative Code Refinement

Structured plan → code → evaluate → refine cycles for higher code quality:

- **Phase Decomposition** — Break complex tasks into 1-5 sequential phases
- **Iteration Loop** — Up to 3 iterations per phase (10 total): plan, code, run lint/tests, score, decide
- **Objective Evaluation** — ruff lint + pytest with dynamic score weighting and hard caps
- **Failure Mode Guidance** — Targeted responses for timeout, syntax, import, test, and lint failures

Integrates with `experiment-craft` for stuck diagnoses and `evo-memory` for loading prior strategies.

### ✍️ `paper-writing` — Section-by-Section Paper Drafting

A proven 11-step workflow for writing academic papers with LaTeX templates:

- **Structured Process** — From pipeline sketch → story design → Method → Experiments → Related Work → Abstract → Title
- **Section Templates** — Three Abstract templates, four Introduction openers, Method module structure, Experiments organization
- **LaTeX Assets** — Annotated paper skeleton (`paper-skeleton.tex`) and booktabs table macros (`table-style.tex`)
- **Writing Principles** — One message per paragraph, topic sentence first, terminology consistency, reverse-outlining
- **Counterintuitive Tactics** — Underclaim in prose / overdeliver in evidence; lead with mechanism, not just metrics

### 🔍 `paper-review` — Self-Review & Quality Assurance

Systematic self-review before submission using adversarial and counterintuitive review strategies:

- **5-Aspect Checklist** — Contribution sufficiency, writing clarity, results quality, testing completeness, method design
- **Reverse-Outlining** — Extract the outline from finished paragraphs to verify logical flow
- **Figure & Table Quality Checks** — Captions, resolution, booktabs, color-blind friendliness
- **Rejection Simulation** — Force a reject summary first; attack your own novelty claim
- **Handoff to Rebuttal** — After review, feed identified weaknesses into `paper-rebuttal` for response preparation

### 💬 `paper-rebuttal` — Rebuttal Writing After Peer Review

Dedicated rebuttal skill for responding to reviewer feedback after peer review:

- **Score Diagnosis** — Color-code every reviewer comment: red (critical), orange (important), gray (minor), green (positive)
- **Champion Strategy** — Arm your most positive reviewer with evidence for the Area Chair discussion
- **Tactical Writing** — 18 rules for structure, content, and tone in rebuttal responses
- **Counterintuitive Principles** — Submit even with extreme scores; concede small points to win the big argument
- **Common Concerns** — Response strategies for 12 frequently raised reviewer complaints

### 🎤 `academic-slides` — Presentation & Research Talk Creation

A structured approach to creating academic presentations and preparing research talks:

- **Narrative Arc** — Define scope, audience, and key takeaway before touching slides
- **Slide Design** — 10 design rules, visual hierarchy, one idea per slide, claim-style titles
- **Practical Creation** — `.pptx` file generation with color palettes, layout code, charts, and figures
- **Delivery & Q&A** — Rehearsal protocol, timing, and backup slide preparation
- **Counterintuitive Rules** — Slides are not your paper; enthusiasm beats polish; related work builds motivation, not citation counts

### 🧠 `evo-memory` — Persistent Research Memory & Self-Evolution

The learning layer that accumulates knowledge across research cycles. Maintains two memory stores and implements three evolution mechanisms:

- **Ideation Memory (M_I)** — Tracks feasible and unsuccessful research directions across ideation cycles
- **Experimentation Memory (M_E)** — Stores reusable data processing and model training strategies (paper core), plus architecture and debugging (extensions)
- **IDE (Idea Direction Evolution)** — Extracts promising directions after `research-ideation`
- **IVE (Idea Validation Evolution)** — Classifies experiment failures as implementation vs fundamental direction failures
- **ESE (Experiment Strategy Evolution)** — Distills reusable patterns from successful experiment pipelines

Read by `research-ideation` and `experiment-pipeline` at cycle start; updated after each cycle completes.

### 📚 `paper-navigator` — Academic Paper Discovery & Reading

Focused paper workflow in four stages — from query to evaluated reading list:

- **Disambiguate** — Analyze user intent, resolve ambiguous terms (project names, module names) to actual paper titles
- **Discover** — 7 discovery paths: keyword search, citation traversal, recommendations, author tracking, arXiv monitoring, trending detection, GitHub search
- **Evaluate** — Quick assessment via TLDR, citations, code availability (HuggingFace + GitHub), and top models by task
- **Read** — Full-text retrieval via Jina Reader with 3-level reading strategy (Technical, Analytical, Contextual)
Includes Python scripts powered by Semantic Scholar, HuggingFace, GitHub, arXiv, and Jina Reader APIs.

### 🍌 `nano-banana` — AI-Generated Slides & Illustrations

Generate professional presentation slides and high-quality illustrations using Gemini's image generation API, with an interactive browser-based review loop:

- **7-Phase Workflow** — Content planning conversation → slides_plan.json → style selection & batch generation → browser review → feedback editing → PPTX packaging → cleanup
- **3 Visual Styles** — Lineal Color (flat icons, educational), Gradient Glass (glassmorphism, premium), Vector Illustration (retro, approachable)
- **Interactive Review** — Local HTTP server with per-slide feedback; edits are applied without regenerating the entire deck
- **Multi-Model Support** — `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` (best quality), `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` (fast iteration), `gemini-2.5-flash-image` (rapid prototyping)
- **Counterintuitive Rules** — More planning = better slides; edit don't regenerate; never read generated images yourself (use the review server)

### 🧮 `evomath-tao` — Tao-style Olympiad Proof Workflow

A rigorous proof workflow that operationalizes Terence Tao's research-math practice for contest-style mathematics. Outputs a complete proof, a verified counterexample, a calibrated partial result, or a clean handoff — never a hand-waved "PROVED":

- **5-Step Protocol** — Plan Briefly → Try Candidates → Assemble → Audit → Reflect, driven by TodoWrite + per-phase validators
- **5-Round Internal Mini-Process per Candidate** — Solve → Self-improve → Self-verify → Correct → Repeat. **No tool use during Solve** (pencil-and-paper discipline)
- **5 Honest Status Labels** — `PROVED` / `REFUTED` / `VERIFIED_NUMERICALLY` / `CONJECTURED` / `HANDED_OFF`. Numerical evidence is NOT a proof
- **3-Safeguard Audit** — Verifier context isolation, asymmetric voting (4 HOLDS to confirm, 2 HOLE FOUND to refute), pigeonhole exit
- **Named-Pattern Screen** — Library of recurring failure modes (P4, P5, P6, P18, P40, P41) checked before any PROVED award
- **Calibrated Abstention** — When verification fails repeatedly, the skill downgrades the status instead of bluffing

**IMO 2025 evaluation (Claude Opus 4.7, 6 parallel subagents):** 4 PROVED (P1 / P2 / P4 / P5) · 1 CONJECTURED (P3, c = 4 with odd-prime gap) · 1 HANDED_OFF (P6, 2112 sketched). All 6 numeric/classification answers match the official IMO 2025 keys.
