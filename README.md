> **Paper Suite**: The paper skills work as a pipeline — **planning → writing → review → slides**.

### 📐 `paper-planning` — Research Paper Planning & Outline Generation

Guides pre-writing planning before a single word is drafted. Covers four key activities:

- **Story Design** — Reverse-engineer the narrative: task → challenge → insight → contribution → advantage
- **Experiment Planning** — Plan comparisons, ablations, and demo scenarios with structured checklists
- **Figure Design** — Pipeline figures that highlight novelty; teaser figures that hook reviewers
- **Timeline Management** — 4-week countdown schedule from outline to submission

Includes counterintuitive tactics: write your rejection letter first, narrow claims before broadening, and plan fallback narratives.

### 🔍 `paper-review` — Self-Review & Rebuttal Preparation

Systematic self-review before submission using adversarial and counterintuitive review strategies:

- **5-Aspect Checklist** — Contribution sufficiency, writing clarity, results quality, testing completeness, method design
- **Reverse-Outlining** — Extract the outline from finished paragraphs to verify logical flow
- **Figure & Table Quality Checks** — Captions, resolution, booktabs, color-blind friendliness
- **Rejection Simulation** — Force a reject summary first; attack your own novelty claim
- **Rebuttal Preparation** — 18 tactical rules, champion strategy, score diagnosis, and word count optimization

### ✍️ `paper-writing` — Section-by-Section Paper Drafting

A proven 11-step workflow for writing academic papers with LaTeX templates:

- **Structured Process** — From pipeline sketch → story design → Method → Experiments → Related Work → Abstract → Title
- **Section Templates** — Three Abstract templates, four Introduction openers, Method module structure, Experiments organization
- **LaTeX Assets** — Annotated paper skeleton (`paper-skeleton.tex`) and booktabs table macros (`table-style.tex`)
- **Writing Principles** — One message per paragraph, topic sentence first, terminology consistency, reverse-outlining
- **Counterintuitive Tactics** — Underclaim in prose / overdeliver in evidence; lead with mechanism, not just metrics

### 🎤 `academic-slides` — Presentation & Research Talk Creation

A structured approach to creating academic presentations and preparing research talks:

- **Narrative Arc** — Define scope, audience, and key takeaway before touching slides
- **Slide Design** — 10 design rules, visual hierarchy, one idea per slide, claim-style titles
- **Practical Creation** — `.pptx` file generation with color palettes, layout code, charts, and figures
- **Delivery & Q&A** — Rehearsal protocol, timing, and backup slide preparation
- **Counterintuitive Rules** — Slides are not your paper; enthusiasm beats polish; related work builds motivation, not citation counts
